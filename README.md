# Mövius der Krächzer
This repo documents the progress in a small fun project where I started to develop my own bot for a friend's Discord server. It started as my first Python project and the two main goals are to keep everything as functional possible while having fun exploring the possibilities and features of the language and the Discord API. 

## Functionality
Right now this bot does text only. It can react on commands (!), answer to requests (?) or just reply to a trigger string inside a message. The main feature right now is it's ability to announce Twitch streams of the server owner. It doesn't use Twitch API or anything related, all of this is done via commands.
Over the years, some fun commands were added the portfolio. These are mainly based on inside jokes, but there are also some mini-games or utility-functions hidden inside the command tree.

## Documentation
This bot is not meant for productive use, so there's no documentation of the commands. I'll add a file for this later.

## Changelog
So after many commits, I decided to add version numbering and I'll try to follow some system here.
The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/f0xit/moeviusbot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## ToDo
To keep track of things I have to do, wether it's a feature or a fix, I created a list which can be found The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/f0xit/moeviusbot/blob/master/TODO.md).
