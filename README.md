# Mövius der Krächzer
This repo documents the progress in a small fun project where I started to develop my own Discord bot for a friend's server. I've never really build a Python project before and it's also my first time working with the Discord API, so right now there are bugs ... many bugs ... but I'll try my best and learn as fast as possible.

## Functionality
Right now this bot does text only. It can react on commands (!), answer to requests (?) or just reply to a trigger string inside a message. The main feature right now is it's ability to announce Twitch streams of the server owner. It doesn't use Twitch API or anything related, all of this is done via commands.

## Documentation
As I said above, right now this bot is not meant for productive use, so there's no documentation of the commands. I'll add a file for this later.

## Changelog
So after many commits, I decided to add version numbering and I'll try to follow some system here.
The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/f0xit/moeviusbot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## ToDo
To keep track of things I have to do, wether it's a feature or a fix, I created a list which can be found The changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/f0xit/moeviusbot/blob/master/TODO.md).
