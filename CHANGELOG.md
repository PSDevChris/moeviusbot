## 0.1

### Added
- A changelog and software version numbering, starting right now and updated with every git push
- Started a proper readme file to tell a litte more about this repo and to better track project status

- Refactored the setting file feature. It checks for the corresponding .json files, if they don't exist, it stops with the log to copy the .def file and remove that part from the filename.
